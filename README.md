Mocka ‚Äî A Mock Server for Developers by Developers, made with Swift ‚ù§Ô∏è.

‚òïÔ∏è Getting Mocka
===============

To build it yourself or to contribute, look at the [Development](https://github.com/wise-emotions/mocka#-development) section for more information.

üöÄ Features
===========

Here is the list of the most important currently implemented features:
- [x] Server section with a list for all the network exchanges automatically updated
- [x] API Editor included in the app
- [x] Console section with a list for all the logs automatically updated
- [x] Wildcard components in order to be able to define `*` paths
- [x] App fully written in Swift by using SwiftUI, Combine, and Vapor

If you want to see what's next, read the [Wanted Features](https://github.com/wise-emotions/mocka#-wanted-features) section.

You can also go to the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/wise-emotions/mocka/projects/1) board to see the Mocka backlog.

üíª Usage Requirements
=====================

| **Mocka** | **macOS** |
|-----------|-----------|
| 0.1.0     | 11.2      |

‚öôÔ∏è Build Requirements
====================

| **Mocka** | **Swift** | **Xcode** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0.1.0     | 5.3       | 12.4      |

üßë‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª Development
================

We currently use `XcodeGen` in order to generate the `.xcodeproj` file.
To install `XcodeGen` you will also need `brew`. If you currently don't have those software installed on your Mac, they will be automatically installed at the first run of `setup.sh`.

Currently, the `setup.sh` allows the following parameters:
- `close` to close the Xcode instance
- `format` to format all the code by using [`swift-format`](https://github.com/apple/swift-format)
- `clean` to clean the derived data (at the `.build` folder) and it also run an `xcodebuild clean` command
- `open` to open the Xcode project

For example you can type: `./setup.sh close clean open` to close the current Xcode instance, clean the project, and open the newly generated one.

üêõ Known Issues
===============

1. `testIsWorkspaceURLValidReturnsFalseForMissingServerConfiguration` in `Tests/AppTests/SettingsLogic+Test.swift` Unit Test sometimes fails 
2. The CI fails due to the lack of macOS 11 on GitHub Actions
